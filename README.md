-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678833743/Snake/colour-palette_i1sqta.png">
        The colour scheme was chosen to create a retro arcade game aesthetic. To fit this theme, a dark background colour with contrasting, vibrant colours were used.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The 'Press Start 2P' font is used for the logo, start game button and restart button. This font was chosen to tie in with the retro arcade game theme.
        - The 'Gruppo' font is used throughout the rest of the website with Sans-Serif as the fallback font because Sans-Serif fonts are more accessible for people with reading difficulties.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The start screen image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a bright and playful, retro aesthetic.

        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678888696/Snake/start-screen_rlsjjj.png">
        * The start screen also contains a 'Play Game' button, which when clicked will trigger the game screen to display so that the user can play the game:
        <br>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678890010/Snake/play-game-button_bantql.png">
        * The 'Play Game' button also gives visual feedback to the user when hovered over that the button is clickable, by changing colours and cursor.
        * This makes the website more dynamic:

        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678890161/Snake/play-game-button-hover_urbmhl.png">
    -   #### Gameplay Area
        * The gameplay area consists of a grid with a grey background colour to optimize visibility against both the dark website background and bright game elements.
        * Another element of the gameplay area is the turquoise-coloured snake, which grows after every collision with the food. The direction of the snake can be controlled by the user through using the keyboard arrow keys or the arrow button controls that display on-screen for mobile users.
        * The gameplay area also displays a randomly-placed, red-coloured food which disappears when the snake collides with it, then reappears randomly-placed on the grid again.
        * It is important that the game can be played all devices so the gameplay area was designed to be responsive and work well on all screen sizes.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678890869/Snake/gameplay_cpccvb.png">

        * The 'Restart' button also gives visual feedback to the user when hovered over that the button is clickable, by changing colours and cursor.
        * This is consistent with the styling of the 'Play Game' button on the start screen, and helps to make the website more dynamic:
        <br>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678900101/Snake/restart-button-hover_jomwyc.png">

- ### Features for Future Implementation
    * I would like to implement more complex JavaScript code to reset the game and return to the start screen when the 'Restart' button is clicked.
    * Some music or game sounds could be added to the website with a button so that users can decide whether they want sound or not.
    * Introducing a leaderboard where players can submit their names and scores could make the game more competitive.
    * A celebratory screen could be added to display when a user sets a new high score.
    * Various difficulty levels could be introduced.

   <details><summary>Mobile:</summary>
   <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678950611/Snake/responsive-mobile_zgepvb.png"></details>

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari 
    browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and multiple mobile 
    devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   A great amount of testing was done to ensure that there were no bugs affecting the gameplay.
-   Friends and family members were asked to play the game and provide feedback to point out any 
    bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   Lighthouse was used to test the site on Google Chrome:
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1678958997/Snake/lighthouse_pvfctk.png">

### Bugs
#### <em>Fixed:</em>
- Initially, I considered using a canvas element for the game area, but this proved tricky to resize for smaller screen sizes without breaking the game. Instead, I decided to use a CSS grid layout for the game area, which solved the resizing issue and made the game more responsive.
- I was having an issue with the page scrolling when the keyboard arrow keys were used to play the game, which was frustrating for players. I solved this issue by adding an event listener to the script.js file so that on the keydown of any of the keyboard arrow keys the default actions belonging to these events will not occur.
- I noticed that if the arrow keys or controls were pressed while the start screen was displaying, the game would play in the background without being displayed and once a game over condition was met (i.e. the snake hit one of the walls) the game over screen would display without the user ever actually playing the game. I solved this issue by declaring a variable named displayGame which is set to false while the start screen or game over screens are being displayed, and set to true only when the game area is being displayed. I then added an if condition to the game controls, so that they can only be used if the game area is displaying to the user.

#### <em>Still Existing:</em>
- No known bugs at this time.
